### Keeb stuff

## GMMK Pro
* I use Vial since there is Rotary Encoder support that VIA doesn't have
* I have my .json from when I used VIA, I still use the same layout
# Specs
* PBT Darling (Aliexpress clone of GMK Darling)
* --> Plan to replace with KAT Mizu (Probably getting delayed by 10 months lol, all my homies hate KeyReactive)

TODO Learn to make subheadings in Markdown ^^^
* Stock stabs (They suck and get stuck)
* 67G Tangerine Linear Switches, lubed (Tybosis 3204) and filmed (DESKEYS Switch Films)
* Gold Rotary knob, black frame (future plans to powder coat navy blue)

## KDB67 Lite R3
* Just got it, haven't done much to it

#Plans
* GMK Dots R2
* Stock stabs (They are perfect with the [hoolee mod](https://youtu.be/-vhpHjlkRgQ))
* 62G Boba U4 (The silent ones, this is my portable keeb)
